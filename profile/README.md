# Pregnancy Calculator and Guide: Medication, Weight Gain, Exercise & Nutrition

A very useful tool for expecting mothers is a **pregnancy calculator**. With it, they are able to estimate a due date, track important milestones, and know what to expect week after week. Depending on whether you use the **last menstrual period (LMP)**, **conception date**, **IVF transfer date**, **ultrasound**, or even the **due date**, a pregnancy calculator is helpful for planning out the upcoming months.

## Why Use a Pregnancy Calculator?

Pregnancy calculators provide personalized insights into a particular user’s journey with pregnancy. With the addition of entering a preferred date such as LMP or conception, the calculator can generate:

- An estimated **due date**  
- Current week of **pregnancy**  
- **Trimester stage**  
- Detailed **week-by-week** timeline of milestone achievements through the baby’s growth  

Pregnancy calculators also determine key developmental milestones like when the baby’s heartbeat is detectable, when the chance for miscarriage declines, and when a preemie can survive outside the womb.

## How Much Weight is Healthy During Pregnancy?

Gaining weight is expected during pregnancy for the baby to develop. The amount of weight that needs to be gained is dependent on your **pre-pregnancy BMI**:

- **Underweight**: gain 28–40 lbs (12.5–18 kg)  
- **Normal Weight**: gain 25–35 lbs (11.5–16 kg)  
- **Overweight**: gain 15–25 lbs (7–11.5 kg)  
- **Obese**: gain 11–20 lbs (5–9 kg)  

Gaining weight gradually is important. To ensure the baby grows properly, eat energy-packed, nutrient-dense foods as part of a balanced diet.
